Elephant has a number of settings stored in JSON format in your home directory, in file ".com.pinktwins.elephant.settings".

Some of these settings are not exposed in Elephant's UI. Use any text editor to apply these settings:

{
    "fontScale": 1.0,

Make all fonts small/bigger. Does not affect layouts so scaling too much will negatively affect appearance. Yet, scaling slightly can be helpful with high-res screens.

    "pastePlaintext": true,

When true, any text is pasted in plain text. Default is false.

    "autoBullet": 0,

Whether to automatically create lists when starting a line with * - or +
Default is 1 (for true).

    "confirmDeleteFromTrash": true,

Confirm when deleting a note from Trash. Default is true.

    "allowFilenameChars": "aeiouy",

Additional characters allowed in note's filename. The filename is based on note's title, and by default only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and . - are allowed, other chars are converted to _.

    "useLucene": 0,

Use Lucene for search indexing. 1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default is to use Lucene.
When lucene is disabled, a simple in-memory structure is used for searching. You should not need to care about this.

    "defaultFiletype": "txt",

Default file type when creating a new note. Default is to create note files with .txt extension,
in plain text format. Change to "md" to create new notes in markdown format.

    "charset": "UTF-8",

Force a specific character set for notes. Default is to use your system's default character set. Example is "UTF-8" to force UTF-8.

Note that Elephant doesn't convert your notes' character encodings - if you previously used non-ascii characters and change the character set, your notes might need to be converted to the new encoding to display correctly.

Disabling note preview in Note List

Create an empty file called ".disablePreview" in a notebook folder to disable note preview in Note List.

This is useful with notebooks containing passwords, for example - the preview will not give away the note contents.
